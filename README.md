# leaflet-challenge

This challenge is designed to visualize earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) using Leaflet.js. The objective is to create an interactive map displaying earthquakes based on magnitude, location, and depth. An optional part of the challenge involves overlaying tectonic plate boundaries to analyze seismic activity patterns.

Technologies Used
	•	JavaScript
	•	Leaflet.js (for mapping and visualization)
	•	D3.js (for fetching GeoJSON data)
	•	HTML & CSS
	•	GeoJSON (for earthquake and tectonic plate data)

The following features were used for earthquake visualization:

 Interactive Leaflet.js map displaying earthquakes.
	•	Circle markers represent earthquake locations.
	•	Marker size scales with earthquake magnitude.
	•	Marker color varies based on earthquake depth.
	•	Popups provide earthquake details (location, magnitude, depth).
	•	Legend explains color coding for depth.

 The challenge was accomplished with the assistance of a tutor during a scheduled tutoring session.
